# raster-R
An introduction to working with raster data in R, starting with satellite images of the TROPOMI sensor on board the Sentinel-5P satellite (S5P, ESA) 

The S5P is an atmospheric remote sensing satellite of the Copernicus mission, its data are freely accessible and allow the analysis of air quality and atmospheric pollution levels with a spatial resolution of 7 km approx. We will evaluate the levels of NO2, a pollutant generated by the combustion of fuels at high temperatures (e.g. motor vehicles). We will analyze the levels of this gas over the city of Buenos Aires at two different times: before and after the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown. After, we will evaluate the change in NO2 levels over a year in a cattle field in northeast Argentina. NO2 is also produced by burning biomass, and an increase in its concentration is usually observed due to fires or controlled burns.
